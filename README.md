<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
### About The Project

A state manager built from scratch, which avoids unnecessary rendering of state managers like the Context API. The Zustand library was used as the main reference for creating the methods. As an example application, a task list application was used, but the state manager can be applied to any other situation.
